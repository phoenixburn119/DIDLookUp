# DIDLookUp
The function of this script is to verify the accuracy of a managed DID sheet. You will use this sheet to allocate DIDs to new hires but eventually it will become
hard to manage due to terminations not getting caught and other small errors. It will pull DIDs from the master sheet then compare them to your Teams environment
to see if that number still belongs to that user/resource. If an error is seen it will report that on the final export csv. All DIDs will be shown on final report
and corrections can be made.
